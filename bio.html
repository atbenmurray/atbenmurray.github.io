  <p>The second running of Cryptic: Art and Science in 2017 saw us return to the Crypt
  Gallery on Euston Road. It featured our work and the work of eighteen other artists
  working in the subject matter of art and science</p>-->
  <h1>Cryptic: Art & Science 2017</h1>
  <p>Phenotypica is an initiative created by computer scientist Ben Murray and artist Neus Torres Tamarit
in 2016. Our objective is to create evocative artworks and immersive experiences about genetics and
evolution that engender an emotional response so that audiences react to scientific concepts and
practice as a human experience.</p>
  <p>Working at the intersection between art, science, and technology, we are interested in how artworks
about genetics interact with the subject and with the audience, and how accurately such artworks
present their scientific concepts.</p>
  <p>We view both programming and art as intensely creative, intuitive and technical disciplines, and
draw from both to give us a novel collaborative approach and artistic practice that attempts to
remove the boundaries that too often separate science from the rest of human activity and reveal
the creativity and beauty that is revealed by scientific discoveries.</p>
