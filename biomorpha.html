  <p>Biomorpha (Evolving Structures) is a mixed media installation that combines a
    digital interactive installation, a series of acrylic and bioplastic sculptures,
    holograms, photo-etchings and a performance. The project explores the idea that
    an organism is limited by the success of the mutations of its ancestors and how
    evolutionary pressure accelerates the mutation rate in an organism that is
    adapted to an environment that originally has stable conditions.</p>
  <p>Biomorpha begins in a stable evolutionary environment to which it is very well
    adapted. The presence of audience members entering its space represents a
    sudden, dramatic shift in this landscape to which Biomorpha is no longer well-adapted.
    It immediately begins to undergo a series of mutations that gradually adapt
    it to the presence of the audience members, by moving closer to them.</p>
  <p>Biomorpha is a metaphorical organism that represents many species over many
    generations. In the real-world, dramatic changes may drive many or even most
    species extinct which affording only a few lucky species the chance to dominate
    the new environment through a rapid epoch of speciation.</p>
  <p>Special thanks to Ben Murray for his help in developing the software, to Dr Max
    Reuter for his contribution in genetics and evolution and to Aimee Dulake and
  Jessie Richardson for their involvement in the performance.</p>
  <p>This is Neus's final project for the Masters in Art and Science at Central Saint
    Martins, exhibited at the Degree Show in May 2017.</p>

  <!--<p>This artwork explores the dramatic evolutionary pressure that can be caused by
    a sudden change in a speciesâ€™ environment. An organism that is well adapted to
    a relatively stable environment can stay largely unchanged for millions of years.
    In a continuously changing environment, a species can undergo dramatic changes in
    a relatively short time, as there is a high potential for mutations that help it
    to survive in the new environment. In Biomorpha, the audience is the evolutionary
    pressure.</p>-->
