    <p>The second running of Cryptic: Art and Science, curated by Neus Torres Tamarit
      was held in November, 2017. It featured nineteen international artists and a
      debate on the subject of art, science and technology, organised by Ben Murray
      and <a href="http://www.clotmag.com/Clot">CLOT Magazine</a>. The panel included
      <a href="https://www.arthurimiller.com/">Professor Arthur I Miller</a>,
      Professor Emeritus at UCL and author of numerous books on the subject of art
      and science, Dr Max Reuter, Evolutionary Biology Reader at UCL and leader of
      the Reuter Laboratory, where Neus is artist in residence, and artist and
      designer <a href="http://www.adampeacock.co.uk/">Adam Peacock</a>.</p>
    <p>Hosted for the second time by the evocative Crypt Gallery on Euston Road
      and building on the success of the inaugural exhibition in 2016, Cryptic
      featured an international selection of nineteen artists, including
      postgraduate students and alumni from Central Saint Martins, Slade,
      Westminster University and Middlesex University.</p>
    <p>Cryptic examines the relationship between art, science and technology, and
      features artworks that use technology and science variously as medium or
      message. In 2017, the rich and diverse subject matters included representations
      of time, mutation mutated into abstracted expression, exploration of form and
      material, genetics and evolution, synthesis of emotions into sculptural and
      crystalline forms, the multiverse, religion through the olfactory sense,
      technology, control and new materialities, social media, climate change, and
      plastic waste.</p>
    <p>Cryptic took place from Friday 24th to Monday 27th of November.</p>
