  <h1>8th - 11th March, 2018 - Affordable Art Fair, Battersea</h1>
  <p>We had the great opportunity to exhibit our digital interactive installation
    Biomorpha (Evolving Structures) at the Affordable Art Fair from the 8th to the
    11th of March.</p>
  <p>Biomorpha explores the dramatic evolutionary pressure that can be caused by a
    sudden change in a species’ environment. An organism that is well adapted to a
    relatively stable environment can stay largely unchanged for millions of years.
    In a continuously changing environment, a species can undergo dramatic changes
    in a relatively short time, as there is a high potential for mutations that help
    it to survive in the new environment. This changes happen over a large period of
    time that is not perceptible for humans in real time.</p>
  <p>In Biomorpha, the audience is the evolutionary pressure whom are tracked by a
    Kinect sensor when entering Biomorpha’s environment. The digital organism
    mutates at an accelerated pace, in order to adapt to the new environment that
    the audience is creating for it.</p>

  <p>For this exhibition we introduced a new feature in the software that captured
    all the evolved forms resulting of the interaction with the audience, for use
    in further artworks.</p>

  <p>We had a great amount of audience of a wide range of ages interacting with our
    digital organism, and it was a great experience to have the artwork installed
    in the centre of the fair, surrounded by international galleries.</p>

  <p>Technically, we chose a more simplified set up to install Biomorpha, according
    to the specification of the exhibiting space that we were allocated. We had two
    entrances to the installation and we also installed a vinyl floor.</p>
