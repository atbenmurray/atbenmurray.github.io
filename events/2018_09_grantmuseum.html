  <h1>Agonism / Antagonism</h1>
  <h1>19th September to 19th December 2018</h1>
  <h1><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/grant-museum-zoology">Grant Museum of Zoology</a></h1>
  <p>The culmination of Neus' residency in the Reuter Laboratory of UCL with
     Dr. Max Reuter. Come and see artworks on the genetic phenomenon of sexual
     antagonism from physical sculpture to computer animations.</p>
  <p>Agonism / Antagonism explores the uneasy alliance that exists between genders. The
     different needs of the genders within a species inevitably result in a phenomenon known as
     genetic antagonism, where what is best for the species may be actively detrimental for one
     of its genders to the benefit of the other.</p>
  <p>Agonism, a political theory that emphasises the importance and necessity of conflict within
     politics, is a good metaphor for genetic antagonism; its inevitability within sexually
     reproducing species implies that it plays an important role in evolution.</p>
