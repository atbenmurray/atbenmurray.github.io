  <p>This year the Norwich Science Festival is going virtual!<p>
  <p>We are taking part in the panel discussion on Monday 26th October 2020 from 7-8pm, with Dr Simone Immler,our collaborator from University of East Anglia and other artists and scientists, who have been collaborating in very exciting projects.<p>
  <p>We'll be discussing how the arts have helped scientists view their research from new perspectives, given artists fresh inspiration, and helped both researchers and artists engage with the public in exciting and innovative ways.</p>
