  <h1>Art and Science in Interaction</h1>

  <p>Phenotypica is an initiative created by computer scientist Ben Murray and artist Neus Torres Tamarit in 2016.
  Our objective is to create evocative artworks and immersive experiences about genetics and evolution that engender
  an emotional response so that audiences react to scientific concepts and practice as a human experience.</p>
  <p>Working at the intersection between art, science, and technology, we are interested in how artworks about
  genetics interact with the subject and with the audience, and how accurately such artworks present their
  scientific concepts.</p>
  <p>We view both programming and art as intensely creative, intuitive and technical disciplines, and draw from both
  to give us a novel collaborative approach and artistic practice that attempts to remove the boundaries that too
  often separate science from the rest of human activity and reveal the creativity and beauty that is revealed by
  scientific discoveries.</p>
