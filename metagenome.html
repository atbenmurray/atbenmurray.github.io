  <!--<p>Metagenome is a series of works and workshops done in collaboration with the Tate Exchange, between 2015 and 2017</p>-->
  <p>Ophelia Sequenced 1 and 2 were developed as part of the BP Art Exchange / Tate Exchange programme at the Tate Britain
    and Tate Modern, London. BP Art Exchange / Tate Exchange is a global learning project about international collaboration
    and exchange and I took part in the programme from 2015 to 2017.</p>
  <p>After getting inspired by Ophelia, by John Everett Millais, one of my favourite artworks from the  Tate Britain
    Collection, I took a fragment of a metagenome sequence and I composed my first artwork Ophelia Sequenced 1 that was
    exhibited at the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology last December 2015.</p>
  <p>I did this by cutting the original artwork in strips and creating a system by which I could reassemble the artwork
    according to the metagenome sequence.</p>
  <p>After the first artwork, I decided to make another piece, Ophelia Sequenced 2, using the same system but another
    fragment of a metagenome sequence; the objective was to see how the artworks differed from each other.</p>
