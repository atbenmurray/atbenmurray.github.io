    Public engagement activity that we created in collaboration with Dr Christelle Soudy (Senior Laboratory Research Scientist at the Crick) and artist Bea Haynes for the Crick Late on 13th March 2019.

    The workshop consisted on constructing a giant protein strand sculpture that wove through and around lab equipment commonly in use at the Crick.
