  <p>Creative Complexity is a Wellcome Trust public engagement project that we have developed in collaboration with Dr Sam Chawner and Catrin Hopkins at University of Cardiff.</p>
 <p>We are designing and running workshops to explore mental health topics for people whose conditions are linked to rare genetic conditions. We are in the process of delivering the workshops and talks with patients, family members, carers, clinicians, and researchers who live and work with such genetic disorders, particularly in the time of COVID-19.</p>
 <p>We'll update the website soon with the outputs. If you require more information, please contact us at hello@phenotypica.org</p>
