      We also wanted to have a more visual output to the project and we created a drawing
      workshop. We kept the activity very open: any technique could be used, as we know that not
      everyone feels comfortable drawing.

      We made a call for people to create images through a newsletter posting to the ImagineID
      cohort (University College London). Rather than a workshop format, we made this activity
      offline, to be done in the participants’ own time and then they would send us the drawings
      with a brief explanation of what the drawing represented.

      We received an amazing artwork by Vanessa, who was diagnosed with Williams Syndrome. She
      sent us a collage of herself and all of her favourite things. In her family's words:

      "This artwork was based on one of the crafts in the CBBC program ‘Art Ninja’. The presenter,
      Ricky Martin, took a selfie of himself and added lots of images which represented himself and
      made a collage.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
      Vanessa’s artwork shows Vanessa’s image in black and white in the middle and is surrounded by
      everything she likes, does and enjoys. She selected the images from magazines or catalogues,
      then cut and stuck them around herself. Vanessa enjoyed making this collage and would like to
      share it with others."
