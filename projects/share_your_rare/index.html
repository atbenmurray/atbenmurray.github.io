    Share Your Rare is a Wellcome Trust public engagement project that we have developed in
    collaboration with Dr Sam Chawner and Catrin Hopkins at University of Cardiff.
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
    We are designing and running workshops to explore mental health topics for people whose
    conditions are linked to rare genetic conditions. We are in the process of delivering the
    workshops and talks with patients, family members, carers, clinicians, and researchers who live
    and work with such genetic disorders, particularly in the time of COVID-19.
  </p> -->
  <p>
    For this collaboration, we have developed workshops to be delivered both online and in person
    to connect with people in the rare genetic condition community. Our goal has been to bring
    together people who live with rare genetic conditions, their families, and the researchers and
    clinicians working on these conditions professionally, with a focus on the lived experience of
    those with rare genetic conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We created workshops to explore these themes through two media, poetry and drawing.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the poetry workshops, we used a form of poem known as a Cinquain Poem; a five line
    structured poem format that is a wonderful way of capturing and distilling the essence of a
    topic. Through Cinquain Poems, we explored the themes of mental health and living with or
    working on the research and treatment of rare genetic conditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    These workshops took place during the Covid-19 pandemic, so we took the opportunity to also
    explore living through Covid-19 as a poetry theme.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our drawing activity was originally designed for people to do in person or offline, for people
    who preferred to represent their topic visually rather than through poetry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Share Your Rare has created a number of artistic outputs through the workshops and events; you can navigate
    around the site using the buttons below. We present the poems and images resulting from the
    workshops, as well as artworks created from the output of the workshops.
  </p>
  <p>
    As well as engaging with the rare genetic condition community, we were given the opportunity to
    run these activities during Cardiff University's
    <a href="https://www.cardiffsciencefestival.co.uk/subatomic-circus">Subatomic Circus</a> event
    in the summer of 2021. Both poetry and drawing activites proved to be very popular,
    and the poems and images from this event can also be explored by clicking on
    the button below.
  </p>
  <!-- <p>We'll update the website soon with the outputs. If you require more information, please contact us at hello@phenotypica.org</p> -->

      This video artwork is inspired by the variety and diversity of experiences within the rare
      disease community. It is also a scientific metaphor for the variability in medical symptoms seen
      in rare genetic conditions. For example, 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q) also known as
      Velo-Cardio-Facial Syndrome (VCFS) and DiGeorge Syndrome is a rare genetic condition where one of
      the two copies of chromosome 22 has a section of DNA deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although many people have the 22q deletion in some form, the high variability and its
      interaction with genes of the other chromosome 22 mean that each person’s experience of having
      this is different. The video artwork starts with a protein sequence belonging to the 22q region
      appearing on the screen that gradually disappears, giving place to a Cinquain poem. This poem
      is a recombination of all the poems about rare genetic conditions that we have collected from
      the project participants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poem words become a stencil of what resembles a nature scene, to reveal a landscape shortly
      afterwards. Moreover, different videos of nature start overlapping and creating a complex scene
      with layers of images and audio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst doing research for Share Your Rare and creating the artwork, and as we were working with
      poems and words, I read several papers about metaphors that doctors often use with patients and
      the positive or negative impact that these have on them. I read a more neutral metaphor about
      genetics and epigenetics being nature’s pen and pencil set, and somehow these reminded me of
      the videos I recorded during the lockdown period in 2020 and 2021 at the local woods. I would
      go out to take a break from the confinement, and I would look up: I’d see the layers and layers
      of branches and leaves and I would think about this as a visual metaphor for the complexity of
      so many things interacting with each other in genetics and epigenetics. So we decided to use
      them for the video.
