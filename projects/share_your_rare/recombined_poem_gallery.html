    Following on from the Genetic Alliance workshop, we wanted to show how peoples' individual poems
    were recombined and presented as shared experiences. The participants chose lines from the poems
    written by themselves and their fellow group members in the first phase of the workshop, and
    created new poems. Looking at the results, we can certainly see that certain lines of certain
    poems were strongly evocative or compelling to people, or were able to take on slightly altered
    meanings in their new context.
  </p>
  <p>
    We thought of this process as being something like genetic recombination, and we were happy at
    the outcome. Not only did we see people recombining lines, but we also saw the poetic equivalent
    of replacements, insertions, deletions, translocations, and other 'poetic mutations'. We have
    presented these here in a manner that evokes the presentation of mutations in sequences of DNA.
