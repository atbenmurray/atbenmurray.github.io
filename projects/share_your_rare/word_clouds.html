    We wanted to perform some analysis on the poems that people submitted through the various channels;
    workshops, events, and newsletter / social media calls. We settled on work clouds for this, and present
    the result of the analysis below.

  <p>
    We have created two word clouds, one for the poems on the subject of Rare Genetic Conditions, and one
    for the Subatomic Circus events on the subject of a Rare Summer.
