  <!--<p>This artwork explores the dramatic evolutionary pressure that can be caused by
    a sudden change in a species’ environment. An organism that is well adapted to
    a relatively stable environment can stay largely unchanged for millions of years.
    In a continuously changing environment, a species can undergo dramatic changes in
    a relatively short time, as there is a high potential for mutations that help it
    to survive in the new environment. In Biomorpha, the audience is the evolutionary
    pressure.</p>-->

  <p>Machines do not see as humans see. This artwork reflects on computer vision, the branch of artificial      intelligence (AI) that seeks to give computers high-level understanding of images. When we watch AI performing computer vision tasks within their comfort zone, it is easy to conclude that they are performing the task just like a human would. When we see their failure modes, we are often baffled by how arbitrarily wrong they can be.</p>
  <p>The Detectron2 network was created by Facebook AI Research in 2019. It is a state of the art computer vision network that has many capabilities; one of which is the ability to perform semantic segmentation. We are unfair to this network, asking it to carry out a task that humans find trivial but that represents an unsolved problem in AI. We pan across a series of artworks from The National Gallery collection, and watch it struggle to consistently interpret elements of the resulting images. The network is trained on a huge number of photographs, representing mundane scenes from everyday life. Artworks are not, in general, everyday life. They are ‘out of distribution’, containing historic scenes and unusual juxtapositions of objects, entities and odd perspectives. Perhaps more importantly, the objects and entities are rendered through application of paint and the artist’s lens, texturally divergent from photographic representations. Humans, through a variety of mechanisms that AI has yet to replicate, view an artwork and trivially perform the translation from interpretation to symbol. AIs do not.</p>
