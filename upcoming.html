<h1>Institute of Making, University College London - Saturday 24th March, 2018</h1>
<p>We are at the Slime event at the Institute of Making at UCL (Malet Place) this
Saturday 24th of March from 1pm to 5pm. We have a stand called; Art from Polymers;
DNA, Bioplastic, and Fruit Fly Cocoons. We'll have two artworks exhibited, we'll
be preparing bioplastic live, and we'll be discussing what bioplastic is, what
biodegradable means and how the three polymers inspire our artwork.
</p>
<p>Free event and family friendly!</p>
